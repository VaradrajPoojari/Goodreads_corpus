I am going to disagree with thousands of goodreads reviewers. This book is crap.Okay, all you trolls. Go ahead and tell me what a philistine I am, how ignorant I am of Greek literature and mythology, and how my failure to appreciate this book reflects my limitations rather than those of the book. You don't really need to bother defending this book, because the masses seem to agree with you. But if you ask me, this was a Harlequin. Boring Patroclus is wholly infatuated with the impossibly perfect Achilles, who, even more impossibly, returns Patroclus's passion. Lots of purple prose, lots of love, daring battles, blah, blah, blah. I got about halfway through and decided I was finished wasting my time.I'm fine with Patroclus and Achilles being in love, but a little complexity PLEASE. How about some characterization? How about some relationship tension from within, not just without?I've read some glorified Harlequins that managed to break my snob barrier -- Outlander and Water for Elephants to name just two. Sadly, this one didn't. Perhaps this was, in part, because all the accolades led me to expect something far more literary or deep. And maybe had I read The Iliad I would be more excited by the references and more forgiving of the book's flaws.So feel free not to take my word for it, but I found this book incredibly disappointing.

Sure, I had heard of Anne Frank, I knew who she was, what she did, what happened. She is a historic figure, and a tragic one certainly. But I didn't make the really personal connection until I read her words, this diary. Her words bring her to life again. What a precocious young girl, so smart, so full of life; a life with so much promise, so much hope. She thinks, even writes, very much like a young girl would today. I think that's why so many young people feel a connection with her still. It's not a great work of literature. It can be tedious at times, even repetitive. But it's an important contribution to history. It tells a story that needs to be told again and again, not forgotten. Yes, Anne's words do give her life, and they will break your heart.

She is wracked with guilt because of the fact that her father is a serial killer. She found the evidence that led to his conviction. She self medicates with illegally prescribed prescription pills. But then the murders of young teenage girls start again. She suspects several people when she finds evidence linking them to the current crimes. Because of the false clues, I was not sure of the actual killer until near the end. She does solve the mystery.Two quotes:Chloe's description of Home: ""A home isn't just a house, a collection of bricks and boards held together by concrete and nails. It's more emotional than that. A home is safety, security.""Louisiana bayou: ""Once we pass the clearing, I can't help but gasp at the beauty of this place. The bayou is wide and lazy, peppered with cypress trees emerging from the murky water, their knees breaking the surface like fingers reaching for something to grab.

Shortly after her birthday with the fear that her older sister, Margo may be taken by the Nazis the Franks disappear into the night and go into hiding. It is through Kitty that Anne records her thoughts and daily life living behind a bookcase in the secret annex.When I was younger I went through a ""holocaust"" phase before moving on to Harriet Tubman and slavery. The funny thing is that Anne Frank's Diary was not the first Holocaust book I read, I think that was The Devil's Advocate. Anyway,I soon became fascinated by the Secret Annex and the secluded life she lived for two years. Unfortunately she and the other occupants of the Annex were betrayed and sent to concentration camps with only her father Otto Frank surviving. The tragic thing (not to minimize the inhumanity of it all) is that Anne died mere weeks before liberation.

They travel the galaxy, seeking to utilize their skills to solve various problems, typically on behalf of a rich prince or king. The machines usually turn out not quite as expected. Like Henry Kuttner's classic The Proud Robot.There's really nothing quite like Stanisław Lem, wildly imaginative and wholly original. Like Kuttner and Robert Sheckley, much of his writings have a witty, humorous edge. I don't know if there's a deeper message in these stories, about the inherent fallibility of machines and robots, or if they are intended purely as entertainment. Maybe a bit of both. Quite a bit of the humor seems rooted in mathematics, though Lem himself was not a mathematician, scientist or engineer as far as I know.There's something about these stories that make me think of Jack Vance's classic The Dying Earth series. I could easily imagine the robots as two rival wizards doing their best to outdo each other, or some despotic monarch, with absurd demonstrations of their skill.

It is difficult to go against the grain on a book that is nominated for so many awards. So as always you  need to judge for yourself because books fit people differently  Quite simply this book didn't  Fit Me. I really have no interest in reading about 18-20 something year college kid's on/off sexual relationships where they seem to only exist in their own little complex bubble and this book felt like a bubble. It is described as ""exquisite love stroy"" which I honestly found nothing exquisite or no love in this one. The characters of Connell and Marianne were dislikable and boring and the on / off, will they wont they ""relationship"" became repetitive reading. The only character which I liked and felt any connection with in the novel was Lorraine.Perhaps this is more suited for a younger audience where they connect with the college scene or for readers who like complex relationship stories but for me this was a struggle from start to finish.","Counter({'annoyed': 2, 'confused': 1, 'love': 1})",annoyed,0.3333333333333333

Partially written by a ghostwriter, the memoir scans Malala’s childhood and adolescence as well as the recent history of Pakistan, but it addresses neither subject comprehensively. An excessive amount of information about Pakistani society is presented piecemeal, leaving much unclear; these passages overwhelm Malala’s own story, without ever giving a clear sense of the country’s politics, government, or culture. The transitions between the life writing and the explanatory prose also tend to be clumsy, and the writing feels rushed. The book is at its best when it focuses on Malala’s goals, beliefs, and accomplishments, but it’s clear that a more thorough (auto)biography remains to be written.","Counter({'confused': 3, 'annoyed': 2, 'bored': 1, 'content': 1})",confused,0.3333333333333333

33N1S8XHIXPVDRR1MIVRY58UWFDZ1I,The Cyberiad,Stanisław Lem,Science,5.0,"I first ran across The Cyberiad in desperation. It takes me next to no time to read books, so I quickly drained every last inch of our bookshelves by eighth grade, and the library had nothing.My dear lord. Before I get into the writing itself, let's not forget the briliant translation, and this book would not be easy to translate, between alliterations, rhyming, and the sheerly brilliant nonsense (I use brilliant so much because one simply can't use that word enough when speaking of this book.), he had a Herculean challenge and met it.Now, when it comes to the writing of Lem himself, you reach a new level. Most science-fiction fans will gladly preach the gospel of the European sci-fi authors, and Lem is unquestionably a great among them, in no small part due to The Cyberiad. While fans of hard sci-fi may find the ridiculous, operatic, humorous, pseudo-scientific stories pretty much revolting (though I doubt it), no one can deny the uniqueness of his worldbuilding (surprisingly deep, for nonsense) or the fabulous anti-hero, Trurl.I feel terrible not being able to give more, in case someone hasn't read it, but it would not be right to reveal the glory here. Suffice it to say that this should live on every bookshelf, genre-bound or literati, and should be reread often and with much gusto.

Her human rights advocacy for education and for women has transformed into an international movement; her courage to keep fighting after getting shot exemplifies her heroism. Her voice has reached so many and has influenced history. She has impacted the world by speaking out, and she writes about her father's support as well, adding back story to her honest desire to make a difference in the realm of Pakistani politics and female education.Saying all of that, my rating of I Am Malala pertains in no way to Malala herself. I felt that this book fell short in portraying Malala's story: it jumbled up Pakistani history, politics, and Malala's own experience in a way that did not make much sense. The book's disjointed, impersonal structure disappointed me, and I wish we could have read a more linear, cohesive narrative all from Malala's viewpoint. We all know the power and wisdom of Malala's voice; I would have enjoyed I Am Malala if I had heard more of it.If you want to learn a little more about Malala's upbringing, Pakistani history, or the Taliban, I would still recommend this book. It does a good job of sharing Malala's story, even though it could have done a lot better.","Counter({'disappointed': 2, 'content': 1})",disappointed,0.5

Stanislaw Lem departs from his occasionally dour disposition (see: Solaris) with a series of very funny but also deeply philosophical ""journeys"" of a pair of Cybernetic engineers (Trurl and Klapacius). Each journey is a short story that stands alone, yet the whole collection is a complete consistent work. Lem uses absurdist plots and situations to poke fun at politics, religion, romance, war and even science. The translation into English is phenomenal, keeping an incredible amount of linguistic play and puns. In one of the stories, Klapacius challenges Trurl to construct a machine that can create anything that begins with the letter N. Trurl succeeds, though the machine can't make Natrium (plain old salt) because, if it could make anything that began with N in any language in the universe, it could be a machine that could make anything at all, which is clearly impossible. Klapacius then orders the machine to make Nothing, and the valiant constructors must act quickly to save the universe.

By trying to be creative, it basically seemed like he used a math or science term and added a couple letters to the end of it to make it sound latin. It felt very forced and unimaginative. A couple of these in a paragraph to give something a name would have been fine, but every sentence seemed almost made up of this gibberish (Thisicus wouldabar be the naminad of a personia or a sentencera).

3D0LPO3EBM3G4TOXWYRJWUC0JWJOY3,The Cyberiad,Stanisław Lem,Science,4.0,"I want to start off by saying that I rarely enjoy reading short fiction. I find it hard to commit or give a damn and I just want to get it all over with...like most people would feel about a common household chore. So many are nothing more than whispers of plots involving under-developed, overly-melodramatic characters that will be left behind after 20 pages, so why bother. Others seem to serve as nothing more than an author's literary masturbation (trademarked, not to be used without written permission of Spacewanderer, Inc., 2012), snapshots of the human condition framed in tiny little shadowboxes that, hopefully, were more rewarding for the author to write than they are for me to read. The fact of the matter is, the short story is fundamentally flawed and, as such, extremely difficult to write well. Not that there aren't good short stories and talented short story writers out there. It's just that there are so few. And even fewer entire collections of stories.I found ""The Cyberiad"" to be one of those rare examples. I actually cared about the two main characters, partly because they are likable, and partly because they are resident in each of the stories, so you get to know them. But, more importantly, stuff actually happens. Stories have conflict AND resolution. What a concept! As far as I'm concerned, this book should be required reading in every MFA writer's program in the United States.","Counter({'enthusiastic': 2, 'love': 1})",enthusiastic,0.5

Shea is stunned when the infamous Beth Greer walks in to the medical office where she works. Shea boldly asks Beth for an interview and is surprised when its granted.

Sleep teaching is a time honored trope, but this novel overuses the concept.I personally got bounced out when the MC took possession of his new real estate property and discover a mysterious bunker. Basic realty concept is that the seller has to make the buyer aware of all structures on the property *and* any hidden defects they are aware of.

Most had barely spoken since high school but all are, for different reasons, eager to escape their current lives and relive some of the fun times they used to share. Their very first event involves abseiling down the side of the lighthouse, one of the few man-made structures on the island, and very nearly ends in disaster for one of the group. Is someone sabotaging them? And, if so, just which of their many secrets does their persecutor want vengeance for?This was a solid thriller, featuring an isolated island setting and an untrustworthy friendship group who all had something to hide. Basically, my favourite set-up for a mystery! I loved how Bennett kept a stream of mysteries consistently being revealed, which ensured I had many theories present at any one time, and that my focus was often misdirected from what was really occurring.This was fun, fast-paced, and full of twists and turns that heightened my intrigue as I flew through the pages.

I really wanted to use this book to escape for the weekend but I just struggled to get into it. While the synopsis sounded promising this book just felt dull to me.

None of the characters were particularly likable and this added to the struggle. I found myself not caring who died or how they died.

I also didn’t get a good feel for who the characters really were - generally I understand that all the mains are easy going with quick senses of humor, but that was applicable to them all without much differentiation. Only difference is one is an easy going former doctor, one is an easy going mechanic, and one is an easy going interstellar guide who apparently is female and thus immediately the love interest of Bob.

Nice to find some modern sci fi that made me smile and on occasion laugh out loud. For once the aliens are generally friendly and not that different from us in they have life's, loves, and their own problems. Characters are generally engaging especially the central character of Bob. I don't have a problem with the first person perspective the stories are written from unlike other reviewers. It's basically the good old southern hunting, shooting, and fishing, old boy in outer space with a huge tendency to cross reference TV, cinema, and other modern culture. True it's not great literature but for me it's a fun read and I powered through a book of the series every day and still want more. There are always slight negatives with any writing and here we have a not unusual US centered view. for example hundred of aliens are lost on Earth over the last few hundred years and they all seem to have landed in North America. So a references occasionally to the rest of the world or non US characters would be more realistic. To some the running jokes could get monotonous and are occasionally over done. My only other issue would be sometimes things are resolved a little to easily than is believable.As I said a light enjoyable romp of a series.","Counter({'annoyed': 2, 'confused': 2, 'enthusiastic': 1, 'bored': 1, 'content': 1})",annoyed,0.16666666666666666

It's definitely light, and easy to read.I'd say that this is somewhere between an amateur and semi-pro level of writing, if that makes any sense. The whole thing is just a straight narrative, told mostly via dialogue. The story structure itself is also really simple, without any real arc to speak of. It's not embarrassing fan-fiction level stuff, though. For what it is, it's well-written enough that it's easy to follow and easy to like.So it's not a challenging read, and it would probably have gotten a bad grade if it was handed in as a writing assignment for a traditional creative writing class.

Nor are the characters described, except Nikki vaguely. Bob and John are just names.

I had such high hopes for this novel, but it ended up being a long slog that went nowhere.I couldn't connect with or believe in any of the characters (the male characters were particularly undeveloped) and the epistolary device didn't work at all; it just felt like a vehicle for Rooney to muse on pseudo-deep ideas. SO many pages of telling and describing the actions of characters and their physical movements (almost as if to help guide a future tv/film adaptation) which did nothing to forward the plot. I am looking forward to hearing what other readers make of this. If we're making direct comparisons to Rooney's previous novels it's definitely more like Conversations with Friends than Normal People in my view: pretentious people stewing over relationships which seem doomed/not worth pursuing from the get-go. The book also felt very auto-fictional to me - the protagonist Alice has written two books which were very successful, one of which has been adapted for tv/film - which was unexpected but also didn't really come to anything beyond us getting a glimpse into the psyche of a reluctantly famous and private author.","Counter({'content': 2, 'disappointed': 1})",content,0.5

Perhaps that made my expectations too high. The primary story centers on Eleanor, who travels to a remote mansion that she inherited after the brutal death of her grandmother. The secondary story focused on Anushka, living in that same house decades ago. I liked Anushka’s story better, though Eleanor’s story was creepier. There was a good deal of action, as strange things started happening almost as soon as Eleanor and her party arrived. The author does a good job of creating a creepy atmosphere and making it easy for the reader to visualize. The ending definitely packed some surprises, and the convergence of the 2 stories was well done, even more so with the added variable of Eleanor’s “face blindness” condition, which leaves her confused about things that she sees.

As Vuong explains in his 2016 poetry collection, “Night Sky With Exit Wounds,” his grandfather was a U.S. soldier who found a farm girl in Vietnam. “Thus my mother exists,” he writes. “Thus I exist. Thus no bombs = no family = no me.”That willingness to solve the equation of his own existence, no matter what its components, is a. . . .

Vuong presents an atemporal account of life as Vietnamese immigrant in America. Vuong's imagery is painstakingly accurate and incredibly clever. He also captures the child's voice really well (the observations we make as children, but miss as adults). At once beautiful and heartbreaking, this novel is a masterpiece.","Counter({'bored': 2, 'confused': 1, 'annoyed': 1, 'enthusiastic': 1})",bored,0.25

They easily fit into the conversation with bestselling authors like Riley Sager and Jennifer McMahon. In 'The Resting Place', Eleanor is a young woman who suffers from face blindness. She remembers people based on markers like their voice or prominent feature (ex. bob haircut, jewelry, hands etc). Adding to the confusion of seeing the storyline through Eleanor's eyes, Sten uses a Nonlinear Timeline skillfully to make the reader feel as unsettled and anxious as Eleanor does. It is slightly confusing to start with but quickly you begin unraveling who everyone is. After Eleanor's grandmother's death she is invited to an old family mansion that she knew nothing about, rife with family secrets and a foreboding atmosphere the plotline slowly unfolds. I'm not a fan of unreliable narrators usually but Camilla Sten won me over here. I liked the short chapters and even though I wouldn't call this book horror it's definitely a decent mystery, if a bit predictable.

Anecdotes--those that matter to us, TV/film buffs of the world--are soooo ridiculously scant! Its akin to ridiculing a very unique life with a distanced neverwarm life story. It's unfair; all of it farcical with no pathos at all. The chuckles themselves fail to achieve the expected Cheshire Cat grin madness usually achieved by the brilliant ""Weekend Update"" host. This was unexpectedly underwhelming to me. Impersonal, cutesy, with a sinful-zero amount of compelling stories of life in the comedic fast lane. This autobio is vv (very vanilla)--which, you know, took me by surprise. Its interesting to note just how much more personal, more giving (into their brilliant minds, their methods and techniques, their own sides of the tabloid tale...etc.) other comedic autobiographies are then Fey's (Pohlers, Dratchs, Silverman's...).

The premise of the story had me intrigued and I spent a weekend devouring it. It is dark, creepy and unsettling. I could feel the characters fears and worries and had me turning pages way into the night to see what would happen next.Alex is looking for a new life. She wants better for herself and her children. She flees Sydney, packing up her life and moving to Pine Ridge. It is an idyllic, off the grid community and it is perfect to start again. Her teenage son isn't too happy about the isolation but they soon adapt to the slower lifestyle and make new friends. But something disturbing is happening, strange parcels arrive and Alex thinks she is seeing ghosts. And what is with that old farmhouse on the hill? There were points where I was yelling at Alex in my head, some of her decisions were not the most sensible, especially for a mother.

Single mum Alex has fled her abusive relationship and moved with her teenage son, Ollie, and baby daughter, Kara, to a rural ecovillage - Pine Ridge. It's idyllic: off-grid lifestyle, remote location, a welcoming (mostly) community and a magnetic founder (Kit). But Alex's arrival disturbs secrets, and she's shaken by a series of eerily familiar events that seem to be connected to the abandoned farmhouse on the hill. Alex realises that in escaping her own shadowy past, she's stumbled into someone else's. And this time there may be nowhere to run... I had my eye on this one after enjoying the author's previous novel (The Safe Place); this one fully lived up to my expectations and I really enjoyed it. This book alternates chapters between two female perspectives: Alex, who has just moved to the ecovillage and Renee, who used to live in the farmhouse that is now abandoned. Both women have teenage sons who seem to be being targeted by someone or something strange and ominous. It's a tension filled race to the end, and pretty creepy to boot! I couldn't have predicted the ending at all with twists and turns all throughout the book. Overall: I highly recommend this novel for any reader that enjoys an absorbing psychological thriller/suspense story.","Counter({'enthusiastic': 2, 'love': 1, 'content': 1})",enthusiastic,0.3333333333333333

Using as guideposts the works of thinkers as diverse as Elaine Scarry and Qiu Miaojin, the narrator roams among a wide array of shared memories, from his mother's harrowing acts of abuse to her infrequent but intense displays of affection. So, too, does Little Dog contemplate the nuances of his relationships with his grandmother, his absentee father, and his first love, and he reckons with how the legacy of the Vietnam War and the experience of immigration impacted his parents and grandparents.

It takes place in a world where various businesses offer superheroes for hire in regional zones and who are then rivals for corporate contracts. The lead character Andrea Vernon is an administrative assistant who is brought into the title group The Corporation for UltraHuman Protection (CUP for short) working for the chief operating officer Ms. O. The stable of superheroes include characters such as The Big Ax, King Tiger, Lightning Wong, Kitchen Sink, Senor Fuego and Rabbi Diamond. The main villian (or the ""William"" in the office lingo of CUP) is an alien invasion force which gradually reveals itself.Overall it is pretty silly, but it was enormously entertaining due to the good fun of the script and the exceptional performance of narrator Bahni Turpin who handled several dozen different voices throughout the work.Andrea Vernon and the Corporate for UltraHuman Protection was originally released in August 2017 and was also one of the ten free Audible Original audiobooks available for members in May 2020.

The author focused on the failures of each company but completely glossed over what made each product and each company climb the peak to success. I'm assuming the author didn't understand the engineering and science behind why the Tesla Model S and the SpaceX rocket are so amazing and so couldn't explain them. He goes over the failures in detail, but does not talk about the breakthroughs and advancements in nearly enough depth. I got the sense from the book that Musk is a tyrant (which he likely is), but no sense of why he has inspired so many people to work for him or invest in him. This was a really disappointing book.

This isn't a sappy love story as some Murakami fans would like to tell you. Haruki Murakami himself was baffled by the popularity that this story achieved due to the novel's departure from the usual surrealist themes that are associated with his novels. The fame achieved through Norwegian Wood had so profound an effect on the writer that he had to leave Japan and traveled across Europe and lived in the USA for some time, which resulted in the writing of  Dance Dance Dance .Set in the '60s, Norwegian Wood has us walking through the musings of one Toru Watanabe, who looks back to the days of his youth when he participated in student protests and the people he connected with during that time. So is there no love-story? There are allusions to love, but there is no love-story. The prime themes of Norwegian Wood are loneliness, existential ennui, depression and suicide. Though, like most Murakami plots, these themes are brought about with some subtlety. The book made me reflect deeply into the past at times and induced strong feelings of nostalgia. I can safely recommend this to readers of any genre or style of literature.The novel was adapted into a film in 2010.","Counter({'enthusiastic': 2, 'content': 1, 'annoyed': 1})",enthusiastic,0.3333333333333333

I've certainly read many books of this nature that I've found clever and quite enjoyed, but this one was just ok.

It's all told from Frances' perspective. She doesn't seem to be able to figure out what she wants. Nor does anyone else. It gets messy and it stays pretty messy. I was attracted to this one partially because it is set in Dublin, but it could have been anywhere in North America or Europe. I'm at a low three stars because I did enjoy the the first half of Conversations with Friends, but my enjoyment started to wane in the second half.

A new species that comes last is deemed to be not-sentient, a danger to interstellar civilization and is exterminated. It's Earth's turn, and representing us we have washed-up glampunk band Decibel Jones and the Absolute Zeroes.The author explicitly calls out the link to Douglas Adams in the afterword as being the godfather of all SF humor writing, and she doesn't attempt to dodge that here, instead leaning in to the classic Hitchhikers-like bizarre digressions into humorous exposition. The comparison to Hitchhikers is very apt. Still, this book is definitely Valente's own, as Decibel Jones's regret for what happened to the band and his willingness to aggressively embrace the alien and bizarre help strengthen humanity's case. Oort's journey is no less interesting as the ostensible sellout punk musician reaching for the youth that he's left behind.

What is amazing about this writing is its immersive quality; you feel Esther’s restrictive choices and alienation from her world because you ultimately realize the world she has been striving for was never in her grasp. The repeated questions (after she is being treated for her depression) about who will marry her now only reinforce the notion that for the intelligent and talented Esther Greenwood, there had never been a good way to extricate herself from a trap that she had always seen coming.

The Dollhouse is a multiple POV story that centers around a set of twin story follows a set of twins, Angel and Bud, as they are kidnapped from their home. Along with another girl, the twins are forced to endure disturbing recreational of their kidnapper’s childhood memories and tasks that involve severe punishments if they fail. All while time is ticking down on their usefulness and as a result their lives. This lead to to a suspenseful and terrifying atmosphere that constantly had me worrying about the kids’ safety.The last 80 or so pages contained so much tension and suspense that left me debating on how the kids would escape. Although I guessed some of the minor plot twists, the major one shocked me and left me confused and questioning everything I thought I knew. I’m still not completely sure I understood the twist. One critique I had was that the book ended a bit abruptly. The end was one of the most suspenseful parts and I felt that it could have lasted a little longer after all the built up to it. Also, I wanted to see more of how the characters were coping after everything that happened. Overall, The Dollhouse was a thrilling and scary ride from beginning to end and had an ending that left me intrigued for the next book in the series.

3K3G488TSDCLNHRT09EQA2973SXQ5X,The Bell Jar,Sylvia Plath,Classics,4.0,"Based on Plath's own experience of breakdown in college, The Bell Jar charts the deterioration of protagonist Esther Greenwood's mental stability while interning for a fast-paced fashion magazine one summer in New York City. The first-person retrospective narration juxtaposes ironic detachment and impassioned lyricism: Esther swings from cooly assessing the insurmountable adversity she faces as a woman living in a sexist society to recounting the fits of existential despair she suffered the year she lost control over her life. The narrative is tightly structured, the descriptions moving, the characterization nuanced. Considering that the novel is a first-rate work of art with an ambiguous ending, it seems important to approach The Bell Jar on its own terms with detailed attention to its history and form, not its author's act of suicide. Autobiographical as the story is, the book's much more than an unself-aware reflection of Plath's life or an ominous foreshadowing of her death. To overlook the work's artifice or its fictionality not only does a disservice to Plath as an artist but also perpetuates the reductive views about the work of women (writers) that in part prompted Plath to write the novel in the first place.","Counter({'confused': 2, 'disappointed': 1})",confused,0.5

How far we have come in the last few decades in recognizing depression as a mental illness and treating it with much less radical techniques than electric shock. Ester Greenwood is 19 and her future is just starting to unfold. Yet, day by day, she is questioning herself: her capabilities, her confidence, who she is, and what does it mean. Her thoughts turn dark and helplessness envelopes her in a tight, downward spiral. Plath captures the emotional characterization of depression and the utter helplessness that accompanies it.

From the very beginning, even before her breakdown, I found very little to care for or associate with about Esther. She seemed cynical, disdainful, self-important, and manipulative. I just flat out didn’t like her. So when she really began to have some trouble mentally (actually, even before that) I, as a reader, wanted to close the book and get away from her rather than keep reading and see her through it. When I did finish the book, it felt more like a relief than an accomplishment. This is not a story I ever want to revisit. There is much talk of suicide in The Bell Jar and it vividly describes what it can be like to experience a descent into depression. I admire it for what it is but it's just not my cup of tea. It left me feeling gloomy and unsettled. In the same vein, I would recommend Girl, Interrupted by Susanna Kaysen.

I'm sure there is tons of layering to the characters and great explanations for their behavior, so I kept on. We get to the house and I realized I wasn't invested in these characters making it work. Could totally be a case of me, not the book. Plenty of people loved this one and appreciated the angst and grumpy characters, but this is a DNF for me.","Counter({'enthusiastic': 2, 'confused': 1})",enthusiastic,0.5

Revolving around a pandemic – but written before the advent of Covid-19 – it’s told as a series of interconnected stories taking place between the 2030s and the early 22nd century. Among the most memorable characters we meet are an out-of-work comedian who lands a job at the ‘City of Laughter’, an amusement park where dying children can have one last day of fun before they’re euthanised; a scientist whose research brings him into contact with a talking pig (this chapter is far more moving than you might think); and a doctor working at a ‘forensic body farm’ who falls in love with a terminal patient. The stricken Earth is so well-drawn, so palpable, that I didn’t want to move away from it (there’s some space travel stuff that I wasn’t quite as keen on, not because anything’s wrong with it but because I wanted to stay among the survivors). Definitely a novel that bears comparison the work of David Mitchell, especially Cloud Atlas.I received an advance review copy of How High We Go in the Dark from the publisher through NetGalley.TinyLetter | Linktree","Counter({'content': 2, 'disappointed': 1, 'love': 1})",content,0.3333333333333333

Palmer,Mystery,4.0,"***Thanks to NetGalley for providing me a complimentary copy of MY WIFE IS MISSING by DJ Palmer in exchange for my honest review.***On a vacation to New York City, Michael’s wife Natalie and their two children go missing. Video footage suggests she left voluntarily, perhaps due to an affair she believes he’s having with her coworker. Why leave rather than filing for divorce? Natalie has reason to be afraid of secrets from Michael’s past. Very afraid. But how rational is she, suffering from chronic insomnia which can lead to psychosis. Is either a reliable narrator? Oh what a tangled web DJ Palmer has woven with MY WIFE IS MISSING. Palmer always writes compelling characters and plots that keep me turning pages well past my bedtime.Slow to start, I didn’t care about the minutia of his steps when he first found out, I wanted to get into the hows and whys. I think I was *supposed* to be on Natalie’s side, but I was on his. Having an affair wasn’t an excuse to run off with kids and lie to them; her behavior seemed more vengeful than fearful. Soon the secrets and twists emerged, my loyalties and theories shifted as the pace quickened and my interest deepened.I love endings I can’t predict and DJ Palmer gave me just that. Don’t even try to guess. Just enjoy the ride.Mystery and domestic thriller lovers, add Palmer to your must read list, no matter which book. ",Counter({'content': 3}),content,1.0

I can’t explain why it reminded me of that movie so much, maybe it’s the “everything is a mess and all over the place” element in it! Anyway this was so much fun! I didn’t know what to expect going into it, except that it sounds so interesting and guess what? It really was! The family dynamic here is amazing and hilarious. Each one of the aunts was driving me crazy and giving me a mini headache. they were just...a lot! I loved them tho! In times I was thinking poor Meddy, but I was always feeling their love and support for each other. I loved how they showed up for her without hesitation and all their banter was so freakin entertaining. The romance was sweet, but not really developed? Nathan was just so okay for someone who have been unexplainably dumped for years. I wanted more, but I knew it wasn’t going to be the main focus of the story. I didn’t mind that tho, Meddy and her aunts were carrying the book just fine on their own and trust me they had a lot to carry! Overall this was fun, full of mayhem, messy situations, murder, hilarious family moments, rich in Indo-Chinese culture, sweet romance, and many omg moments.","Counter({'confused': 2, 'bored': 1, 'disappointed': 1, 'enthusiastic': 1})",confused,0.25

The first half of the book was so drawn out. I couldn’t stand Natalie and I was annoyed after only 25% with her paranoia. I kept thinking it would get better but it actually got worse. When the chapters were focused on Natalie, I had no desire to read. I had my feelings about Michael from the beginning and can’t say too much or it would be considered spoilers, so I’ll just say that I liked him more than her even though he’s “the bad guy”. Kennett (the detective) he was funny at times but seemed like a character that was kinda just thrown in there. At around 50% it actually started to pick up and I thought maybe it would end as a 4 star….but by 75% I was rolling my eyes again and hated the ending. I also felt like many of the chapters ended with cheesy sentences, like a bad mystery movie. I predicted who the killer was early on and was correct although there was a twist in there that I didn’t see coming. Overall, this one just wasn’t a hit for me and it makes me kind of sad because I loved The New Husband. Sadly, I don’t think I would recommend it.

Today, this steamy, sharp, allllll-the-feels RomCom is out & ready for you to fall in love in love with it! With a clever Set It Up-meets-The Parent Trap premise wherein our leads, Ari the meteorologist, & Russell the sportscaster, decide reuniting their divorced bosses will fix their professional woes, WEATHER GIRL was heartwarming & playful, soft & sexy. It's the kind of romance we need right now—an escape from reality that also makes our human realities feel validated. As with THE EX TALK, I loved the inclusivity in this story & characters—their body types, mental health, cultural & faith backgrounds. Seeing a heroine with depression, a fat hero, two Jewish leads, makes my heart sing. Romance novels deserve as rich a diversity as the world we live in, & the care Rachel took in writing her character’s experiences, especially Ari’s depression, is nuanced & compassionate & deeply affirming.In short, I adored this book. As slow-burn hot as it is achingly heartfelt, WEATHER GIRL reminds us that love isn’t only for sunny sky seasons but for the dark days that many of us weather—that we deserve to love & be loved for who we truly are, rain or shine.","Counter({'content': 2, 'enthusiastic': 1, 'love': 1, 'disappointed': 1, 'confused': 1})",content,0.2

What if you had grown up with a single mother but always wondered what it would be like to have a father? What if you found out you do have a father and he's a famous serial killer on death row? Scarlet's father is so famous there was a popular movie made about him. She watched it with her class at school. Except for a short creepy first chapter, this story is told from Scarlet's point of view. And for much of the novel, Scarlet's attention is on her own social life: girls she shares secrets and vapes with, boys she hooks up with, and her mother who is too controlling. When the FBI asks Scarlet to visit her father in prison, because he says he will tell her, and only her, about his unknown victims, she begins to grow up, and is able to face the killer down better than anyone could have expected. Well written with some unexpected twists. A little too much graphic sex for my taste, but should appeal to teens, the intended audience.","Counter({'confused': 2, 'disappointed': 1, 'content': 1})",confused,0.3333333333333333

When I was in my early 20’s, I volunteered for his 2008 campaign. My point is, I’ve always loved the Obamas, but I never knew much about Michelle. After reading this book, I feel like I know so much more. Her story is inspiring, fascinating, and I adore her.If you’re going to read this book, I can’t recommend the audio book enough. Michelle herself narrates it and I always love when authors narrate their own stories. It makes them that more personal and captivating. I loved reading about her past, her family, and of course when she met Barack and their story. I could relate to some of her story and learned a lot of new things about her.

I love how she starts as a typical annoying teen who balks at her mother's over-protectiveness but when she finds out who she really is, both she and her mother grow closer emotionally but also grow as humans. There was no glamorizing or whitewashing of her father's character and I love how McLaughlin put the emphasis on the many many victims -- not just the women who were killed but on extended family of the victims and of the killer himself.

Let's start with what I loved, which is basically the entire first 90% of this book lol.

Which sounds like it shouldn't work but it SO did and I was all about it. The tension of them knowing all along how they felt about each other but waiting until the perfect moment to act on it was *chef's kiss*. They had so much chemistry and this book was truly just my romance cat-nip. I absolutely ate it up. With all that being said....... I really, really didn't like the way this book ended and I am SO bummed about it. I'm obvs not going to spoil anything, but there was a BIG out of character moment riiiight at the very end of the story that felt like it was added just to sprinkle in some final act conflict and I truly hated how that all went down.

I loved her as a protagonist, and thought she was super fun to follow.I did find myself wishing at times that this novel was a bit more women's-fictiony than it was (think Beach Read by Emily Henry) because I think both of these characters had a lot of potential for introspective growth which felt a bit rushed in favor of romantic angst, tension and furthering relationships.Overall I wouldn't recommend this to somebody, but I also wouldn't actively discourage anybody from reading it either.Thank you to Netgalley and the publisher for an e-ARC!",Counter({'enthusiastic': 3}),enthusiastic,1.0

Sadie is an energetic, smart, hardworking, entertainingly over-the-top individual who finds herself without a job after she rightly, but not so gracefully, calls her boss out on blatant nepotism. A drunken night has her swiping right on Jack, a reclusive, quirky, caring guy who just so happens to be looking for a roommate. Cue funny friendship text chains, group hijinks, a host of floral arrangements and brimming sexual tension. This book was fun. The only thing that didn't quite work for me was the attempt at drama or conflict between the main leads.

It might have been due to the fact that the story was told in Sadie’s first-person narrative and her constant negative self-talk wore on me. There was a reason for it and it served the plot and conflict, but it started to feel manipulative. I’m a fairly smart reader. Please show me in her actions, rather than constantly telling me. I liked Jack as a hero with his mysterious past, but I wanted to love him. More importantly, I wanted to love Jack and Sadie together. I struggled to feel their chemistry and connection. Sadie’s friends were a fun addition and they probably had some of my favorite scenes in the book. I wasn’t as bothered by the final conflict as some readers were, but it again relied on the heroine’s wearisome negative opinion of herself. Aside from some less than artful execution, at times, the overall writing was good and I would try this author again. In this particular story, I felt that there were some elements that were too much, some that weren’t enough, and few that hit me just right.","Counter({'bored': 2, 'content': 1, 'disappointed': 1})",bored,0.3333333333333333

The relationship between Jeremy and Alexis is quite entertaining this time.In my opinion, Kyle Keyes found a new genre mixing all these elements and making a great story for us to get out the box of the genres you usually read, so if you’re looking of something completely different that captures your attention and keeps you on the edge for more, well this series is for you.","Counter({'confused': 2, 'love': 1, 'content': 1, 'enthusiastic': 1})",confused,0.25

If I was worried about four more years of marching towards authoritarianism, I think reading Obama's memoir would have made me more sad than anything else. My early thoughts on this:1. He is a fantastic writer. Yes, I know a lot of that is probably due to editors and assistants. The fact remains, though, that this is an incredibly well-written book. 2. He acknowledges that one of the biggest concerns that many had about his early runs for office was that he tended to be overly verbose and spent more time on policy detail than messaging. That's definitely true of this book. He spends a lot of time discussing finer points of the 2008 financial crisis or even the history of Saudi Arabia that probably wasn't necessary for most readers but is also relatively skimmable.

Maria is written as a likable and endearing character that you will root for. The author does a good job of showing the believable harassment that the jurors experienced after the trial. At first, they receive anonymous notes. Then photographs of those that were murdered are left at their doors. Finally, verbal attacks turn into physical attacks. Maria begins to show symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder due to these attacks. She and her family go on a cruise to help her cope and begin to heal.

Trevor Noah is one of the most effortless narrators I've ever listened to. It genuinely feels like he is sitting down with you and telling you his life story. Not only that, but you get to learn quite a bit about pre- and post-Apartheid South Africa from the perspective of someone who hypothetically shouldn't exist. Noah's mother is black and his father is white, and when he was born any mixed-race relationships were illegal. I was instantly intrigued by his story, not only because of this unique perspective but also because he is such a wonderful storyteller.I do think the chronology of the book was a bit strange at times—one chapter would be from his childhood and then the next would jump to his teen years, and back. And at the end of each chapter there was always a short snippet that completely changed directions and had pretty much nothing to do with the previous chapter (maybe in the physical copy of the book that section is identifiably set apart?).Nonetheless, this was a great listening experience, one that was enlightening, hilarious, heartbreaking, frustrating and well told.

When one of the crew is murdered by a saboteur, and alerts are put out for him and the ship, McKell realizes that he's stumbled into something big. The cargo of the Icarus could upend an interstellar transport monopoly, and a lot of people want to make sure that they get the benefit. It's up to McKell to figure out who to trust in his crew of strangers, along with his partner, an alien Ixil who's a composite being.Zahn blends gritty smuggler space opera a la Firefly or Han Solo with an Agatha Christie parlor murder. It's okay, though nothing to write home about. The setting seems cobbled together out of scifi tropes, rather than a cohesive vision of anything. And as a mystery, the alien tech allows for deus ex machina explanation of what happens, rather than a careful piecing together of clues. Finally, there's the twist. McKell isn't actually a smuggler, he's a deep undercover cop trying to bust a galactic crime lord. This makes some of his personality traits make more sense, but I'm not sure I like a bait and switch that big.","Counter({'enthusiastic': 2, 'bored': 1, 'confused': 1})",enthusiastic,0.3333333333333333

As an aside, special shout out to his Ma, Patricia, whom I understand will be played by Lupita in the upcoming movie adaptation, and while I like Lupita enough, I believe she is unsuited for this role as she herself must well know. South African women have a certain look which is def not Lupita and it would be a shame for Trevor to cede control of casting simply because she was the first person to contact him about movie options. Just saying.Overall,  Born a Crime is an important piece of literature that provides a young man's view of the effects of apartheid, the family dynamic that devolved from being born a crime, and the power of a mother's love.

Written so tenderly, poignantly and with raw honesty. The characters run the gamut from those among us who are the most cruel, the most hateful and those who are able to offer a love that is profound, unconditional and where many of us probably fall, wanting to be better than we are.The characters are human, flawed, some almost too good to be true, and yet it is the moments we don't see, that we hear about that defines this book, in the thoughts of the characters, the empty spaces. How does one forgive one's own past, a place and upbringing that was not ones choice? Why do we hang on to a place, a state of mind, that causes us nothing but pain? The writing is exemplary, the abuse scenes can be graphic, but offset by friendships that are amazing, love that is wonderful. I have read so many articles where critics and readers both decry, ""Where are the published books that will later be considered a classic?"" I think this one will, one of the best, most sincere, if painful books, I have read in a long time.","Counter({'bored': 2, 'confused': 1, 'annoyed': 1})",bored,0.3333333333333333
